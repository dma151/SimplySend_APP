# Project: SimplySend
## Description

SimplySend is a messaging app where users can sign up with an email address, add other users, and message away

### Motivation

While brainstorming different ideas for projects, I was messaging some friends about plans for the later evenings, when it dawned on me that with different friends, different methods/apps were used to communicate with them. The reasons were that one person had an iPhone in contrast to an iPhone or this person preferred the functionality of this app over another. Which brought up a question, "Is there an messaging app that can satisfy all my friends?" And thus came SimplySend.

Also, the framework React was used because of it fluidity in features in rendering components
